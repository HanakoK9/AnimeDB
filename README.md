## this is my first real project lol!

## Obligatory README.md filler text

This is an anime database app I made using ReactJS and NextJS.
I used [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/) to fetch data using Fetch API from MyAnimeList to show top ranked anime and manga, along with an anime search engine. Not responsive as of now cuz I'm too lazy for that (ಠ_ಠ) and not a fan of CSS frameworks either. Regardless, it was fun making this project. Feedback appreciated (≧▽≦)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
