## AnimeDB - Anime Search Engine app

# my first actual project !

This is an anime database app I made using React and NextJS.
I used [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/) to fetch data using Fetch API from MyAnimeList to show top ranked anime and manga, along with an anime search engine and a custom 404 page. Feedback appreciated (≧▽≦)
